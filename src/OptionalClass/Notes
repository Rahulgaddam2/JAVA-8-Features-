Optional<T> Class

1. Why Optional class?
   -> With the use of Optional class we can prevent null pointer exception
   -> we can reduce boiler Plate code
      - if(object != null){
            logic
      }
   -> A container object which may or may not contain a non-null value
   -> An Optional class should not contain null value
   -> There are static methods and non-static methods in Optional Class
   -> we have of() method to keep the element in the container
   -> We have isPresent() method in Optional Class to verify if an element is present or not in the Optional Container
   -> We have get() method where we can extract the element (if its present in container) from the container
   -> we have empty() method is the value is null
